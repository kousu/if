If... (Android Hello World)
===========================

This is a short Android starter project. Feel free to fork and adapt to your needs.

I cobbled this together from reading the android docs and GPL sample code,
because the [official tutorial](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html) insists you use the Google IDE like an asshole.
You don't want to be an asshole, right? 

All this does is show a window, say Hello World, and print [If...](http://www.kiplingsociety.co.uk/poems_if.htm)
to a Toast and to logcat but that should be well enough to get you started.
